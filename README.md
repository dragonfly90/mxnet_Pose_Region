### Reimplementation of human keypoint detection in mxnet

1. You can download mxnet model and parameters(coco and MPII) from google drive:

   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzffphMuhDDMV0RZVGhtQWlmS1U

   or check caffe_to_mxnet folder to download original caffe model and transfer it to mxnet model.
   
   install heatmap and pafmap cython:  cython/rebuild.sh
   
2. Test demo based on model of coco dataset: testModel.ipynb
3. Test demo based on model of MPII dataset: testModel_mpi.ipynb
4. Train with batch_size: TrainWeight.py 
5. Check if heat map, part affinity graph map, mask are generated correctly in training: test_generateLabel.ipynb
6. Evaluation on coco validation dataset : evaluation_coco.py
